# Brave new world

- get setup.py install working on all plats:
    - update to pypi then check
    - Windows: check again
    - Mac OS X: check on clean machine
    - Linux: check on clean machine
- ideas sort from http://daniele.livejournal.com/76011.html
    go -2  # up two dirs, if "-2" doesn't actually exist
    go -src  # walks up to a parent 'src' dir
    go -k*   # like above, but with wildcards? not sure worth it
             # or maybe just always do a prefix search
- test with old drivers and version of script in the way. Do the install
  instructions result in the right thing?
- re-org everything below here
- nicer logging and std logging cmdln-options
- optparse
- drop '-c|-cd' option? Redundant
- improve `mk check_version` 
- restore the DQSD install support. Perhaps just a separate install script
  in src/dqsd?
- drop win9x-isms
- conventions for specifying min Python version? min Py ver is 2.4 here
  (for `python -m` support).

# High Priority

- Cannot install on Mac OS X!!!
  Nor does "go" get on the PATH for Python installs where the python exe is
  symlink'd to!
- Cannot install without 'logging' module (rules out Python 2.2).
- Cannot install and run without PyWin32! Rules out python.org Python out of
  the box. Want a mini-win32api for some of the calls that I use.
- if $HOME is /home/trentm, but that is actually a symlink to
  /usr/home/trentm then "go -a ..." results in usage of /usr/home/trentm --
  which causes problems (e.g. for P4 client view, PS1 prompt "~" shortcut).
- Running "build all" on Windows:

    build: running 'python setup.py sdist -f --formats zip -d C:\trentm\tm\go\bits'
    ...
    adding 'go-1.0.2\.svn\README.txt'

  That is wrong. It should not pick up README.txt from the svn dir.
    

# Medium Priority

- better error message when incorrect number of args
- Add (or respond to email on) environment support as part of dir switching.
  C.f. email "An improvement to your 'go' tool" from Thilo Ernst in gmail.
- Add a check to warn about updating the bash function.
- fix MANIFEST.in processing from picking up README.txt in .svn dirs
- add 'csh' support
- 'go -', or would that be too confusing (could just do "cd -" on shells that
  support that)
- tracking usage stats and "most recently used" etc.
- compare with pushd/popd usage
- Improve GOOBE on linux:
    - go's auto-detection of proper environment does not check for the
      'go' BASH function on Linux, just the presence of the
      GO_SHELL_SCRIPT env var. This is not sufficient: I got surprised
      by it.
- Look at using sys.stdout.isatty() test to try to get "go ..." call
  from the Start Menu "Run" dialog to do something useful.
- test suite
- getting started docs for the DQSD integration
- figure out how Bash autocomplete works and get that to work
