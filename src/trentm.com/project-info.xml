    <whatsnew markup-type="markdown">
        I have moved hosting of `go.py` from my [personal
        pages](http://trentm.com/projects/) to the [go-tool Google Code
        project](http://code.google.com/p/go-tool/).  See the [Change
        Log](#changelog) below for more.

    <pitch markup-type="markdown">
        `go` is a small command for changing directories quickly.
        Typically you have a set of directories that you work in.  Typing out
        the names of those dirs in full can be tedious.  `go` allows you to
        give a shortcut name for a directory, say `ko` for
        `D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel`, and do the following:

            C:\> go ko
            D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel>

        and

            C:\> go ko/test
            D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel\test>

        Think of it as a super `cd`. 

        `go` is free (MIT License).  Please send any feedback to [Trent
        Mick](mailto:trentm@google's mail thing).
    </pitch>
    <installnotes markup-type="markdown">
        Download the latest (1) `go` source package, (2) unzip it, (3) run
        `python setup.py install` in the unzipped directory, and (4) run
        `python -m go` to setup the shell driver:

            unzip go-1.2.1.zip
            cd go-1.2.1
            python setup.py install
            python -m go   # to setup shell integration

        If your install fails then please visit [the Troubleshooting
        FAQ](http://trentm.com/faq.html#troubleshooting-python-package-installation).

    <gettingstarted markup-type="markdown"><![CDATA[
        The most common things you'll do with `go` are adding new shortcuts:

            [~/Library/Application Support/Komodo]$ go -a koappdata

        listing the shortcuts you've created:

            [~]$ go --list
                                Go Shortcuts
                                ============

            Default shortcuts:
              .                     .
              ..                    ..
              ...                   ../..
              tmp                   /tmp
              ~                     /Users/trentm

            Custom shortcuts:
              cgi-bin               /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables
              koappdata             /Users/trentm/Library/Application Support/Komodo
              pyinstall             /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6
              staging               /Users/trentm/Sites/staging
              www                   /Users/trentm/Sites

        and switching to directories using those shortcuts:

            [~]$ go pyinstall
            [/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6]$ go www
            [~/Sites]$ 

        Run `go --help` for full usage details or just [take a look at the
        `go.py` script](go.py):

            $ go --help
            Quick directory changing.

            Usage:
                go <shortcut>[/sub/dir/path]    # change directories
                                                # same as "go -c ..."
                go -c|-o|-a|-d|-s ...           # cd, open, add, delete, set
                go --list [<pattern>]           # list matching shortcuts

            Options:
                -h, --help                      print this help and exit
                -V, --version                   print verion info and exit

                -c, --cd <path>                 cd to shortcut path in shell
                -s, --set <shortcut> <dir>      set a shortcut to <dir>
                -a, --add-current <shortcut>    add shortcut to current directory
                -d, --delete <shortcut>         delete the named shortcut
                -o, --open <path>               open the given shortcut path in
                                                explorer (Windows only)
                -l, --list [<pattern>]          list current shortcuts

            Generally you have a set of directories that you commonly visit.
            Typing these paths in full can be a pain. This script allows one to
            define a set of directory shortcuts to be able to quickly change to
            them. For example, I could define 'ko' to represent
            "D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel", then
                C:\> go ko
                D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel>
            and
                C:\> go ko/test
                D:\trentm\main\Apps\Komodo-devel\test>

            As well, you can always use some standard shortcuts, such as '~'
            (home) and '...' (up two dirs).

            See <http://trentm.com/projects/go/> for more information.

    <changelog markup-type="markdown"><![CDATA[
        ### v1.2.1
        - Fix the helper command line "setup" code to work with Python 2.4.
        
        ### v1.2.0
        - Add support for "go FOO" falling back to changing to subdirectory
          "FOO" if there is no "FOO" shortcut. Patch from Phil Schwartz.

        ### v1.1.0
        - Move to 'go-tool' Google Code project. (Couldn't use "go" because
          Google Code requires minimum 4 (or 3?) characters for a project
          name.)
        - Add automatic setup code to assist with setting up the shell
          integration drivers.

        ### v1.0.6
        - Redo changes to 'function go' that were made in version 1.0.4 so
          that people without my own personal Bash definitions can actually
          use it.

        ### v1.0.5
        - Fix bug where 'go' would fail to switch to a directory with spaces.

        ### v1.0.4
        - Improve Bash 'function go' to fail more gracefully if 'go' is
          not found on the PATH.

        ### v1.0.3
        - Correct information about the suggested Bash "go" function
          definition to avoid a user's possible "which" alias (some RedHat
          systems setup "alias which='type -p'") that can screw things up.

        ### v1.0.2
        - Filter out the stupid FCNTL.py deprecation warning for usage with
          Python 2.3 on Windows.

        ### v1.0.1
        - Ensure the installed 'go' script on non-Windows is executable.
        
        ### v1.0.0
        - Change version attributes and semantics. Before: had a _version_
          tuple. After: __version__ is a string, __version_info__ is a tuple.

        ### v0.9.2:
        - Fix install on Un*x: 'go' script wasn't in sdist to install

        ### v0.9.1:
        - Find gow.cpp again and get gow.exe into dists to fix installation and
          DQSD integration on Windows.

        ### v0.9.0:
        - Move hosting to trentm.com.
        - Improve starter docs a little bit.

        ### v0.8.2:
        - Ensure that "go SHORTCUT" switches to the correct drive on
          Windows when called in a subsystem:window environment (via the /D
          switch).
        - Drop the '-o' option added by the DQSD go.xml search. This means
          that openning the given path in the _shell_ is now the default, as
          it is for command line usage.

        ### v0.8.1:
        - Remove a debugging statement in 0.8.0 that caused "go SHORTCUT"
          to fail from Dave's Quick Search Deskbar.
        - Install go.py as 'go' in Linux, which executable bit set. Before
          this, getting go going was a real pain. It still is somewhat.

        ### v0.8.0:
        - Improve Windows integration: errors are now shown in dialogs rather
          than lost on the non-existant console.
        - Improve DQSD integration. The default action is not to open a shell
          to the stated directory. "go -o" can be used, as on the command
          line, to open a directory in Explorer.
        - Fix bug introduced in 0.7.0 whereby using go's innocuous options
          (-h, -V) could result in a directory change from the last "go"
          call.
        - Add explicit "-c" option for the default "change directories"
          action.
        - Improve shortcut listing output.

        ### v0.7.0:
        - Add an optional argument when listing (-l|--list) to be a pattern
          for existing shortcuts, e.g.:
              go -l foo  # lists all shortcuts with foo in them
        - Add DQSD (Dave's Quick Search Deskbar) integration. After
          installation and a re-start of DQSD you should be able to jump to
          directory shortcuts via "go SHORTCUT[/SUBPATH]" in DQSD.

        ### v0.6.3:
        - first public release
